# RequisitionClustering
This project clusters job requisitions based on candidate preferences, without having any other about the requisitions.

I first use collaborative filtering to learn features of the job requsitions, and then apply a clustering algorithm 
that uses the values of these features in order to cluster the requisitions.

You can see a visualization of the entire process in RequsitionClusteringSummary.pdf
