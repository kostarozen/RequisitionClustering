# RequisitionClustering
This project clusters job requisitions based on candidate preferences, without having any other data about the requisitions.

The same exact process could be appled on other domains where users select items, such as movies, music, likes on social media etc.

Method: use collaborative filtering to learn features of the job requsitions, and then apply a clustering algorithm 
that uses the values of these features in order to cluster the requisitions.

You can see a visualization of the entire process in RequsitionClusteringSummary.pdf
